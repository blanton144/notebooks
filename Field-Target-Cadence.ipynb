    "\n",
    "We need some tools to decide on the field cadence. A basic question is:\n",
    "\"Is cadence $i$ achievable in a field with cadence $j$?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a single exposure cadence is always achievable, but if we\n",
    "need two exposures on a target in cadence $i$ then its achievability\n",
    "depends on the requirements on their cadence and what is on offer\n",
    "under cadence $j$. That is, if cadence i needs a month separation, but\n",
    "cadence $j$ has yearly separations, then it won't work. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we can determine this, we can construct a \"cadence consistency\n",
    "matrix\", $C_{ij}$ which contains the answer to the above question\n",
    "encoded as a 0 or 1 (i.e. False or True). Note that this matrix is\n",
    "decidedly not symmetric. This matrix will be the basis on which we\n",
    "make decisions about which cadences to go for. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the cadence consistency matrix, we have to look at the\n",
    "individual exposures. Imagine we want to get exposures in the cadence\n",
    "specified in cadence $i$. Well, the first exposure in the list needs to\n",
    "correspond to some exposure in cadence $j$. So we will check each\n",
    "possibility in turn.  \n",

    "For each choice of epoch_i(0) = epoch_i(jstart), we now create an Exposure\n",

    "\n",
    " \"Is exposure $i'$ consistent with exposure $j'$ offset by epoch_j(jstart)?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Exposure Consistency Matrix, $E_{ij}$ is 0s and 1s. The condition\n",
    "that the cadence i is achievable under cadence $j$ is equivalent to\n",

    "true for some choice of jstart:\n",
    "\n",
    "    w_{ij} <= E_{ij} for all i, j, AND \n",
    "    \\sum_i w_{ij} <= 1 for all j, AND\n",
    "    \\sum_j w_{j} == 1 for all i\n",

    "cadence $i$ to put in which exposures for cadence $j$.\n",
